    ##
    # A rank filter which attempts to collapse one of the highly ranked, single
    # token keywords into a combined keyword when those keywords are adjacent
    # to each other in the original text.
    #
    # It tries to do this in as intelligent a manner as possible, keeping the single
    # tokens that comprise a combination when one or more of the single tokens occur
    # more often than the combination.
    #
    # This filter operates on the original (non-filtered) text in order to more
    # intelligently determine true text adjacency versus token adjacency (e.g.
    # two tokens can be adjacent even though they appeared in the original text
    # on separate lines with punctuation in between.  However, because it operates
    # on the original text we may fail to find some combinations due to the
    # keyword tokens not exactly matching the original text any more (e.g. if
    # ASCII folding has occurred).  The goal is to err on the side of caution:
    # it is better to not suggest a combination than to suggest a bad combination.
